# Squawker Code

This is a exercise repository for the Squawker example app which is part of Udacity's Advanced Android course. The Squawker example app uses Firebase Cloud Messenger to receive Twitter-like messages, sent from [this server](https://squawkerfcmserver.udacity.com/), in real time. You can learn more about how to use this repository [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud857/lessons/8b2a9d63-0ff5-48ff-90d3-a9855b701dae/concepts/41b82e3c-2797-46e5-8a66-684098ca8cbb).
